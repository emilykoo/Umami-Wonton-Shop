# Umami-Wonton-Shop

This project is a basic game of catching falling objects. The setting is a wonton shop named Umami, for the delicious taste of its wontons. In this game, the user controls the bowl with the cursor, gliding left and right to catch the falling wontons. 

** For future optimization of this project: **
* Thematically-relevant backgrounds may be used for the game as well as the website. 
* Random selection of wontons should be responsive (algorithmically) to the lack of certain wontons, optimizing the selection for continuous flow of falling wontons. 
* Left/right keys and z/x keys should also be connected to the bowl for optimized user-control of bowl. Likewise, speeds will also be set for how fast the bowl can move.
* Scoring should also be created to keep track of how many of each type of wonton the user catches. Scoring should also be reflected on the curtain (as ongoing user-feedback).
